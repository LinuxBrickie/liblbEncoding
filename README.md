## Licensing

As the copyright holder I am happy to consider alternative licensing if
the GPL-3.0-or-later licence does not suit you. Please feel free to reach

## Supported encodings

This is a basic library that only does the things I need for my other libraries
- base64, encoding only
- hexadecimal, encoding only
- bits, encoding only
- SHA1, obviously a one-way encoding

## Notes

Originally built and tested on Fedora 38.
